EXACT INSTALLATION LAB (FOR CODESPACES)
🧪 LAB: Install Kubernetes using kind
Step 1: Install Docker (already present in Codespaces)

Check:

docker ps

Step 2: Install kind
curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.22.0/kind-linux-amd64
chmod +x kind
sudo mv kind /usr/local/bin/


Verify:

kind version

Step 3: Create a cluster
kind create cluster --name cka


Expected:

Creating cluster "cka" ...

Step 4: Verify cluster
kubectl cluster-info
kubectl get nodes


You should see:

cka-control-plane   Ready


🎉 Kubernetes is READY

🧠 This is PERFECT for CKA because:

kubectl → same as exam

Pods, Services, PVC, RBAC → all work

Troubleshooting labs → work

YAML practice → works

Only kubeadm internals are skipped (which exam rarely asks to execute).

❌ What NOT to practice in Codespaces
Topic	Why
kubeadm init/join	Needs systemd
etcd restore (real)	Needs control-plane access
kubelet service debugging	systemctl blocked
✅ How CKA toppers practice

💻 kind / minikube locally

1️⃣ Exact CKA labs using kind (Pods → Services → Troubleshooting)
2️⃣ Killercoda labs for kubeadm + etcd (exam-only topics)
3️⃣ Hybrid plan: Codespaces + Killercoda (BEST)
